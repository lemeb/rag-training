# RAG repository

Repository for code related to the RAG training.

## Prerequisites

1. You will need to have `uv` installed. See how to install it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. You will need an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). After that, you can set it in the `.env` file and in the `rag-template/.env.local` file.
3. To run the RAG template, you will need to have `node` and `pnpm` installed. You can install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [here](https://pnpm.io/installation), respectively.

## Part 1 examples
