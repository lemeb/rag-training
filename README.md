# RAG repository

Repository for code related to the RAG training.

## Prerequisites

1. You will need to have `uv` installed. See how to install it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. You will need an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). After that, you can set it in the `.env` file and in the `rag-template/.env.local` file.

## Part 1 examples

You can find the scripts related to the examples I demoed in part 1 of the training in the `part1-examples` folder.

## RAG template

You can find the RAG template I used in the training in the `rag-template` folder.
